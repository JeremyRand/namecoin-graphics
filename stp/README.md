# Namecoin Graphics in .stp
This is an as-of-today unofficial reproduction of the Namecoin graphic in .stp format, which I tried to transcribe visually from the rest of the Namecoin art using geometric constraints and dimensions. All of them were done in sketch and exported to .stp.

These files can be opened by any ASCII text editor and viewed without the need for proprietary CAD software. I've provided several sizes, including one 10" diameter or 250mm version, a 2" or 50mm version, a 1" or 25mm version, and a 1/2" or 13mm version. They are intended to be used for engraving or embossing and can be filled or left as outlines.

This version has three guidelines which are drawn in phantomlines. The guidelines were necessary for scaling, positioning and proportion, and serve no other purpose than to satisfy constraints when the files were originally drawn. They can be removed or switched off if they are not desired in your final project.
